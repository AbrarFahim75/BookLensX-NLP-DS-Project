## The setup process using docker will be added here as we work further

### 1. Install docker from official source: 
        https://www.docker.com/

### 2. Clone the repository to your local drive.


### 3. Go inside the folder 'assignment1' , make sure your vscode terminal is inside the folder

```powershell
cd ./assignment1 
```

### 4. Build the Docker Image:
```powershell
docker-compose build
```
It takes some time to build and install dependencies and linux kernel, so have some patience.


### 5. Run the container:
```powershell
docker-compose up
```
