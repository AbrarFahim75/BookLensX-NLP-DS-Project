    "2. Apply a spacy-pipeline to visualize the named entities of the first 5 sentences in the dataset\n",
    "(Spacy: spacy.io)\n",
    "3. What is the frequency distribution of the predicted named-entity types?\n",
    "• Limit the evalualtion to the first 100 sentences\n",
    "• Visualize your analysis with one adequate plot type\n",
    "4. Master students: Create a token classification pipeline using huggingface\n",

    "5. How good is spacy's (and huggingface's) NER in comparison to dataset's ground truth?\n",
